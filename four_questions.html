    <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>I'd like to get to know you!</p>
      <p>This is just a quick questionnaire to help me do that:</p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is your name?</li>
        <li>How old are you?</li>
        <li>Where are you from?</li>
        <li>Are you a football fan?</li>
      <ol>
    <script>
    var userName = prompt('What is your name?');
    console.log('Hello, ' + userName + '!');

    var userAge = prompt('How old are you?');
    parseInt(userAge);
    var yearBorn = 2016 - userAge;
    console.log('Oh, you were born in ' + yearBorn + '.');

    var userFrom = prompt('Where are you from?');
    console.log('I hear ' + userFrom + ' is a beautiful place!');

    var userFan = confirm('Are you a football fan, ' + userName + '?');
    if (userFan === true) {
      console.log('Football is a great team sport!');
    } else {
      console.log('Cool! I am not a fan either!');
    }
